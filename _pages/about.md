I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the department of computer science at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/), advised by [Prof.Chengjun Liu](https://web.njit.edu/~cliu/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in mathematics from [South China University of Technology (华南理工大学)](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/south-china-university-of-technology-505115) in 2022.


Research Interest
------
I am generally interested in machine learning, particularly its appliaction in medical imaging and computer-aided diagnosis.
